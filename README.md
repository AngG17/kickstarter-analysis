## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Overall, there were more campaigns that were successful by launch date than there were campaigns that failed or were canceled.  The month of May had the greatest number of successful campaigns, with peaks in both February and October.  These same peak months also had peaks of failed campaigns, so we will want to look at goals set for these failed campaigns to see if that came into play for why they failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While creating the graph for outcomes based on launch date, I had a little trouble with sorting and couldn't remember if 'Sort Z to A' was ascending or decending, so I had to do the filter a couple times in order to make sure that it displayed as requested.  When the rows originally showed with more than just the month, I relied on what I had learned during class and dragged the unwanted date categories out of the pivot table fields to only leave month.  This gave me the rows and columns as requested and I was able to create a chart that looked like the example.

While creating the formulas for outcomes based on goal, I ran into some trouble trying to figure out where the second part of the less than argument was in relation to the rest of the formula.  I was unsure if it made a difference.  The formula I wrote gave me the results I was looking for, so I copied the formula and changed the numbers for the goals in each cell instead of writing it new each time to minimize the risk of making a mistake.
